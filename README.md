## 🎮 Game Overview

In **Feed the Animals**, you play a stationary launcher defending your spot from waves of hungry animals charging your way.  
Your only weapon? Unlimited pizza (or projectiles of your choice)! 🍕

This prototype taught me how to:
- Fire objects from the player
- Randomly spawn and manage enemy objects
- Use **object pooling** to reduce overhead
- Detect and destroy game objects on collision

## 🧠 Key Concepts Applied

| Concept | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Input Handling** | Pressing `Space` to fire projectiles |
| **Prefab Instantiation** | Animals and food objects dynamically spawned |
| **Randomization** | Animal spawn positions and intervals |
| **Collision Detection** | Destroying animal + food on contact |
| **Object Pooling** | For optimized reuse of prefabs |
| **Script Organization** | Clean, modular C# scripts |
